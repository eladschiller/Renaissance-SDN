# Renaissance: Self-Stabilizing Distributed SDN Control Plane
## A floodlight prototype implementation for the Renaissance algorithm [1].

This repository features a prototype implementation of the Renaissance algorithm, using the Floodlight SDN controller. An evaluation of performance is providede as well. This version of the implementation is by Ivan Tannerud and Anton Lundgren, and it builds upon earlier work one by Michael Tran. Emelie Ekenstedt provided assistance along the way.
