# Renaissance: a self-Stabilizing Distributed SDN Control Plane

By introducing programmability, automated verification, and innovative debugging tools, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are poised to 
meet the increasingly stringent dependability requirements of today's communication networks. However, the design of fault-tolerant SDNs remains an open challenge.

Renaissance [1][1] considers the design of dependable SDNs through the lenses of _self-stabilization_ â€” a very strong notion of fault-tolerance. In particular, it is based on algorithms for an in-band and distributed 
control plane for SDNs, which tolerate a wide range of (concurrent) controller, link, and communication failures. These self-stabilizing algorithms ensure that after the occurrence of an arbitrary combination of failures, (i) every non-faulty SDN controller can eventually reach any switch in the network within a bounded communication delay (in the presence of a bounded number of concurrent failures) and (ii) every switch is managed by at least one non-faulty controller.

## A floodlight prototype implementation

This repository features a prototype implementation of the Renaissance algorithm [1][1], using the [Floodlight](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/) SDN controller and [Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/). An evaluation of performance via [Mininet](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/) is provided as well.

### `How to run' guide
1. Move to the folder floodlight_global and build it via the **ant** command.
2. Move to the folder floodlight_local and build it via the **ant** command.
3. While in the floodlight_local folder, start the local controller by typing **java -jar target/floodlight.jar**
4. Open a new terminal and move to the folder where the network topologies reside, namely mininetScripts. Start the desired topology using the command **sudo python "filename".py**
5. A mininet prompt will show up once the network has been started. In the prompt, use the command **xterm h1** to open a terminal on host 1.
6. In the newly opened terminal on host 1, move to floodlight_global and start it by using the command **java -jar target/floodlight.jar**
7. You are now able to see the network being discovered by the global controller. To run more than one controller, repeat steps 5-6 for other hosts.

### Code authors and development projects 
This version of the implementation is by [Ivan Tannerud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-tannerud-12416b57/) and [Anton Lundgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anton-lundgren-432a43126/), and it builds upon earlier work done by [Michael Tran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-tran-a1a8b514b/). [Emelie Ekenstedt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emelie-ekenstedt-363463107/) provided assistance along the way. This code was developed as part of two master thesis projects at Chalmers University of Technology, where [Elad Michael Schiller](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elad/) served as the primary supervisor and [Stefan Schmid](https://ct.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/101989/) was the external examiner who was active in the evaluation of the prototype.
